# The point

If we're going to just keep on adding at rooted subtrees, 

then when we look at the perspective of ANY connected subgraph of the tree and the two

"centroid subgraphs" of its children, 

these are the only four scenairios:

1. no intersection
2. full intersection
3. partial intersect with one tree, and no intersection with the other
4. full intersection with one tree, and partial intersection with the other.


In all 4 cases, we know how to deal with it, either by not recursing down or by adding a lazy tag. 

Call in lets me know when 4 happens.
